            <h4>Villanova University - M.S. Software Engineering (2019-2020)</h4>
              <p>I was accepted to Villanova University's Computer Science graduate program as sophomore.</p>
              <p> Upon graduation for my undergraduate degree in May 2019, I will be completing my master's degree in software engineering
                  in a one year program.</p>
              <p>In order to be considered for this opportunity, I was required to have a cumulative GPA of 3.0 or above, and a 3.5 or above

            <hr>
            <p>Here are some things I devote my time to outside of the classroom</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Villanova University Band - I perform at events all over campus and the greater Philadelphia area. In March 2018, I was elected
                  by my peers to be a Webmaster for the Band's website. My duties will include maintaining the content of the website, posting
                  event signups, and creating new user credentials.</li>
              <li> Villanova ACM - I meet with other computer science students every week to discuss current topics in our field and participate
                    in workshops cenetered around an area of computer science. In the 2018-2019 academic year, I will serve as co-president of
                    this club.</li>
              <li>Villanova University Programming Team - I complete coding problems that have been seen in programming competitions bi-weekly,
                  and compare my results with those of other students.</li>
              <li>Villanova Game Development Club - I designed a fighting game with our peers that is similar to current existing fightting games,
                  but our game allowed for a few different things. These include a wrap around screen
                  so the character could not "fall off" any platform,  a zero-gravity ability that allowed the user to flip the camera upside down for
                  a limited period of time, and various types of weapons. </li>
              <li> Music Activities Stage Crew - I build sets and design lighting for plays and musicals.</li>
            </ul>
