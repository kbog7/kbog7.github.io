            <h4> BlackRock (May-August 2018)</h4>
            <hr>
            <p>This summer, I am working as a Production Operations intern at BlackRock. I will be utilizing Linux systems to help maintain
              availability of host servers for clients' data, while also building an application using JavaScript that will aid in daily
              financial aspects of the business.</p>
            <h4>The School District of Philadelphia (June-August 2016 and 2017)</h4>
            <hr>
            <p>Over the past two summers, I have worked as an intern in the School District of Philadelphia's Information Technology
              department. I worked as a member of the Website Redesign team both times, which was a small group that worked on gathering
              user feedback about the old site, designing the format of the new website, and ultimately launching the site with little
              problem.</p>
            <hr>
            <p>I gained valuable lessons from my time at the The School District. I learned how to collaborate with others effectively to
              revamp a product that is crucial to the families of Philadelphia. I learned how to work efficiently on my own to complete small
              tasks and projects that would contribute to our overall goal.</p>
